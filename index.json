lattice）：晶体的美妙算法\n  在漂亮的晶体之下，是原子有序排列的微观结构。\n        非凡一念：晶体不断细分，由同样晶面角度、与整体具有相似形状的元胞      晶体结构=布拉维格子+基元\n类似于“程序=算法+语言”：自然界在创造如单晶矿石等晶体物质时候，基元是具体的物质内容，而由抽象的点构成的布拉维格子则是生成晶体的数学“算法”。按照指定的算法，将基元周期排列展开，就形成万千固态材料。\n  布拉维格子有若干彼此等价的定义：\n(a) 直观定义：布拉维格子是格点的无限周期排列，其中每一个点都等价。即从任何一个格点看出去，晶格都是一模一样的，周边的环境都严格相同。\n(b) 数学定义：布拉维格子中的任意格点都可以表示为$R = \\sum_i n_i \\textbf{a}_i + r_0$，且公式不产生不属于格子中的点。式中${ a_i }$为$d$个（$d$为空间维度）线性无关的向量，称为初基矢量（primitive vector），$n_i$为整数。$r_0$为某常数，当原点取在任一格点上时$r_0=0$。\n(c) 抽象定义：在加法下封闭的不共面的一组矢量集合构成布拉维格子。\n  非布拉维格子的描述：\n非布拉维格子中的任意格点都可以表示为$R = \\sum_i n_i \\textbf{a}_i + \\sum_j r_j$，表示先按照初基矢量集合{$\\textbf{a}_i$}访问最近的布拉维格点，然后再按照{$r_j$}依次访问基元中$n$个不同的点（$j$从0跑到$n-1$）。\n    常见二维格子\n  并非所有周期排列的格子都是布拉维格子。如下图所示，正方和三角为布拉维格子，但六角格子为非布拉维格子。\n  可以将六角格子中的两个点（下图中红色和蓝色）看做一个基元，按照三角布拉维格子将其“生成”出来。因此，六角格子可以视为两套三角布拉维格子嵌套而成，有时人们称这类非布拉维格子为复式格子。\n  单元素晶体将原子视为基元，其微观周期结构可能为布拉维格子或复式格子；多元素晶体总需要将多个原子视为基元，按照布拉维格子周期排列生成。\n          正方格子 三角格子 六角格子        常见三维格子\n  常见三维格子有简单立方，面心立方，体心立方，六角密堆积等。\n          简单立方(Simple Cubic, SC) 体心立方(Body-Centered Cubic, BCC) 面心立方(Face-Centered Cubic, FCC)    ​\t上述三种三维晶格，简单立方，体心立方，和面心立方，均为布拉维格子，每个基元仅仅包含一个原子。但有时为了方便讨论，会将体心立方与面心立方中的若干原子组合视为基元，按照简单立方布拉维格子展开生成，更好地体现了体心和面心立方的对称性，使用更为方便习惯(conventional)。\n  密堆积结构是一类非常特殊的晶体结构，常见的有六角密堆积和面心立方（没错，就是上面提到的FCC！）。\n          密堆积 六方密堆积(Hexagonal Compact Packing, HCP) 面心立方(Face-Centered Cubic, FCC)    从密堆积方式理解两种结构\n        密堆积的A、B、C三种占位点      两种不同的密堆积分别形成六方密堆积和面心立方（还有无数种密堆积方式）         2. 常见晶体结构 下面列举几种常见的晶体材料结构。\n  金刚石结构\n           金刚石 $a=3.57 \\overset{\\circ}{\\rm{A}}$ 俯视图 类似结构：闪锌矿      金刚石结构由单质碳（C）组成，具有非常高的硬度。类似的单质结构还有硅（Si，$a=5.43 \\overset{\\circ}{\\rm{A}}$），锗（Ge，$a=5.66 \\overset{\\circ}{\\rm{A}}$）等晶体。\n  典型的闪锌矿结构晶体包括：碳化硅（SiC，$a=4.35 \\overset{\\circ}{\\rm{A}}$），砷化镓（GaAs，$a=5.65 \\overset{\\circ}{\\rm{A}}$）等晶体。\n  将每个碳原子视为抽象点，金刚石结构并非布拉维格子\n  选取2个碳原子组成基元（$r_0=(0,0,0)$和$r_1=(1/4,1/4,1/4)$），对应布拉维格子为面心立方\n  选取8个碳原子为基元（如何选取 {$r_j$}?），对应布拉维格子为简单立方。\n    NaCl晶体结构\n          食盐晶体 $a=5.63\\overset{\\circ}{\\rm{A}}$ 硬球模型     具有和食盐类似晶体结构的有：氧化镁（MgO，$a=4.20\\overset{\\circ}{\\rm{A}}$），氯化钾（KCl，$a=6.29\\overset{\\circ}{\\rm{A}}$）等晶体。 氯化钠晶体由Na和Cl两种元素组成，取二者各1组成基元，则布拉维格子为面心立方。    CsCl晶体结构\n          氯化铯晶体 $a=4.11 \\overset{\\circ}{\\rm{A}}$ 硬球模型      粉末状的样品由微小的单晶组成。\n  取Cs和Cl两种元素个1个原子组成基元，则布拉维格子为简单立方（注意：CsCl晶体不是体心立方结构）。\n    二维晶体材料——石墨烯（单层石墨）\n         石墨烯的扫描隧道显微镜照片 单层石墨烯结构示意图      英国物理学家安德烈·盖姆和康斯坦丁·诺沃肖洛夫，用微机械剥离法成功从石墨中分离出石墨烯。共同获得 2010年诺贝尔物理学奖。\n  石墨烯具有高强度，高电导等优异的材料性能。\n    双层魔转角石墨烯\n           莫里超晶格 AA，AB，BA 标记不同区域     由于双层魔转角石墨烯的独特 电子关联性质和 非常规超导电性，引起了凝聚态物理学界的广泛关注，可以阅读 Physics Today 的科普文章。   3. 原胞、晶胞和填充率   原胞（primitive cell）与晶胞（cell）\n 晶格的基本重复单元称为晶胞。晶胞按照原胞周期铺展可以不交叠地覆盖整个晶格结构。其中，最小的晶胞取法称为初基原胞（primitive cell），简称原胞。 严格的说，原胞是布拉维格子的基本重复单元的最小取法。需要恰当选取基元，找到晶体结构的布拉维格子后，可以定义其原胞。原胞的一个操作定义是：由布拉维格子初基矢量所构造的平行六面体（三维）或平行四边形（二维）组成。原胞取法不唯一，但体积/面积确定，仅包含一个基元，是我们讨论布拉维格子的最小基本单位。  按照其他习惯选择称为惯用晶胞（conventional cell），含有多个基元，一般非最小单元。 对于体心立方、面心立方而言，惯用晶胞分别为包含2个和4个基元的立方体（见下面讨论），是将若干个基元视为一个复合“基元“时的”原胞“。   晶胞包含了结晶体的重要信息（原子种类、位置，对称性和平移矢量等等），是晶体结构的基本重复单元。考察具体材料的晶体结构，只需要考察其晶胞就可以了，对晶体学研究具有重要的意义。    二维晶格原胞举例\n  初基原胞\n （初基）原胞的选取不唯一，但面积相等，且仅包含一个基元（格点）。 问题：上图中哪几个是合法的元胞？哪几个不是？    惯用晶胞\n           简单长方 有心长方    简单长方： $a,b$构成的平行四边形是最小原胞的一种选取方式，由$c,d$构成的平行四边形呢？（讨论）\n有心长方： $a,b$构成的矩形是何种原胞？$c,d$呢？（讨论）\n  三维晶格原胞举例\n        立方晶系三个成员（简单立方，体心立方与面心立方）的初基原胞和惯用晶胞     **简单立方：**原胞为最小立方体。 体心立方: 原胞为$\\bf{a}_1, \\bf{a}_2, \\bf{a}_3$构造的平行六面体；惯用晶胞为图示立方体。 面心立方: 原胞和惯用晶胞分别为何（讨论）。 问题： 体心立方和面心立方的原胞和惯用晶胞体积分别是多少？    魏格纳-赛兹原胞（ Wigner-Seitz unit cell）\n         二维晶格的魏格纳赛兹原胞 三维晶格（面心立方和体心立方）的魏格纳赛兹原胞（正十二面体、截角八面体）      魏格纳-赛兹原胞是这样的空间点的集合：即他们离布拉维格点R=0比离其他任何布拉维格点都近。\n  操作定义：被一个布拉维格点（原点）到其他所有格点所做的连线的平分线或平分面所包围的最小空间。\n  问题 ：简单正方、简单立方格子的魏格纳-赛兹原胞是什么？\n    填充率计算（参见Sandro的视频讲义，以及喻舜尧同学的 笔记）\n 布拉维格子：填充率=硬球的体积/原胞体积 （二维格子为面积比） 非布拉维格子：硬球体积需要乘以原胞中的硬球数目 重要数字：二维密堆积填充率三角格子最大（$\\frac{\\sqrt{3} \\pi}{6} \\simeq$ 89%）；三维的密堆积填充率为$\\frac{\\sqrt{2} \\pi}{6} \\simeq $ 74%。     4. 晶系分类与对称性   二维布拉维格子：4大晶系（crystal family）5种布拉维格子\n 单斜晶系(monoclinic net)：元胞为普通平行四边形 正交晶系(orthorhombic net)：元胞为长方形，包含简单长方和面心长方两种

Essentially, $partial$TRG systematically extends the concept of second renormalization [PRL 103, 160601 (2009)] where the tensor environment is computed recursively in the backward iteration, in the sense that given the forward process of TRG, $partial$TRG automatically finds the gradient through backpropagation, with which one can deeply \"train\" the tensor networks. We benchmark $partial$TRG in solving the square-lattice Ising model, and demonstrate its power by simulating one- and two-dimensional quantum systems at finite temperature.

By varying the anisotropic coupling constant $Δ$, we obtain the phase diagram of the spin-1/2 Heisenberg XXZ model on the Bethe lattice, where three magnetic ordered phases, namely the ferromagnetic, XY, and antiferromagnetic phases, are found in low temperatures and separated from the high-T paramagnetic phase by a continuous thermal phase transition at Tc. The XY phase is separated from the other two phases by two first-order phase transition lines at the symmetric coupling points $Δ$=$±$1. We have also carried out a linear spin wave calculation on the Bethe lattice, showing that the low-energy magnetic excitations are always gapped, and find the obtained magnon gaps in very good agreement with those estimated from the TTN simulations. Despite the gapped excitation spectrum, Goldstone-like transverse fluctuation modes, as a manifestation of spontaneous continuous symmetry breaking, are observed in the ordered magnetic phases with |$Δ$|$łeq$1.

In general, XTRG can reach low temperatures exponentially fast and, thus, not only saves computational time but also merits better accuracy due to significantly fewer truncation steps. For similar reasons, we also find that the series expansion thermal tensor network approach benefits in both efficiency and precision, from the logarithmic temperature scale setup. We work in an (effective) 1D setting exploiting matrix product operators (MPOs), which allows us to fully and uniquely implement non-Abelian and Abelian symmetries to greatly enhance numerical performance. We use our XTRG machinery to explore the thermal properties of Heisenberg models on 1D chains and 2D square and triangular lattices down to low temperatures approaching ground-state properties.

To illustrate the performance, the thermodynamic quantities of the quantum XY spin chain as well as the Heisenberg antiferromagnet on a honeycomb lattice are calculated by the linearized tensor renormalization group method, showing the pronounced precision and high efficiency.","tags":null,"title":"Linearized Tensor Renormalization Group Algorithm for the Calculation of Thermodynamic Properties of Quantum Lattice Models","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Wei Li","Shou-Shu Gong","Yang Zhao","Shi-Ju Ran","Song Gao","Gang Su"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1285891200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1285891200,"objectID":"de172bd53588df0d104780c4edf141d8","permalink":"https://wlibuaa.github.io/publication/li-2010-a/","publishdate":"2020-02-16T23:34:37.713954Z","relpermalink":"/publication/li-2010-a/","section":"publication","summary":"The two-dimensional Ising model on a distorted kagome lattice is studied by means of exact solutions and the tensor renormalization-group (TRG) method. The zero-field phase diagrams are obtained, where three phases such as ferromagnetic, ferrimagnetic, and paramagnetic phases, along with the second-order phase transitions, have been identified. The TRG results are quite accurate and reliable in comparison to the exact solutions. In a magnetic field, the magnetization (m), susceptibility, and specific heat are studied by the TRG algorithm, where the m=1/3 plateaux are observed in the magnetization curves for some couplings. The experimental data of susceptibility for the complex Co(N3)2(bpg)$·$DMF4/3 are fitted with the TRG results, giving the couplings of the complex J=22 K and J$′$=33 K.","tags":null,"title":"Phase Transitions and Thermodynamics of the Two-Dimensional Ising Model on a Distorted Kagome Lattice","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Wei Li","Shou-Shu Gong","Yang Zhao","Gang Su"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1272672000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1272672000,"objectID":"242ee58450c0508f1cd50a2f6452fc44","permalink":"https://wlibuaa.github.io/publication/li-2010/","publishdate":"2020-02-16T23:34:37.71216Z","relpermalink":"/publication/li-2010/","section":"publication","summary":"The spin-12 Heisenberg antiferromagnet on the distorted honeycomb (DHC) lattice is studied by means of the tensor renormalization-group method. It is unveiled that the system has a quantum phase transition of second order between the gapped quantum dimer phase and a collinear Néel phase at the critical point of coupling ratio $α$c$∼eq$0.54, where the quantum critical exponents $ν∼eq$0.69(2) and $γ∼eq$1.363(8) are obtained. The quantum criticality is found to fall into the O(3) universality class. A ground-state phase diagram in the field-coupling ratio plane is proposed, where the phases such as the dimer, semiclassical Néel, and polarized phases are identified. A link between the present spin system to the boson Hubbard model on the DHC lattice is also discussed.","tags":null,"title":"Quantum Phase Transition, $O(3)$ Universality Class, and Phase Diagram of the Spin-$frac12$ Heisenberg Antiferromagnet on a Distorted Honeycomb Lattice: A Tensor Renormalization-Group Study","type":"publication"}]
