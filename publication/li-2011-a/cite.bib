 abstract = {A linearized tensor renormalization group algorithm is developed to calculate the thermodynamic properties of low-dimensional quantum lattice models. This new approach employs the infinite time-evolving block decimation technique, and allows for treating directly the transfer-matrix tensor network that makes it more scalable. To illustrate the performance, the thermodynamic quantities of the quantum XY spin chain as well as the Heisenberg antiferromagnet on a honeycomb lattice are calculated by the linearized tensor renormalization group method, showing the pronounced precision and high efficiency.},
